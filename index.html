                        <h2>The Start Of The Day</h2>
                        <p>
                            Most people start their day off with an alarm clock. My wife’s day, usually starts around 3am with a cry for mommy from our 8 month old or our 2 year old sneaking into our bed and asking for cuddles. On a good day, they eventually fall back asleep and she gets to squeeze in a quick nap before resuming the day at 5:30 or 6am.
                        </p>

                            There’s no slow start to a day when you have 2 young children. You immediately jump into action with diaper changes, potty training, making bottles and breakfast, cleaning up spit up, changing diapers again, getting dressed and ready for the day. In between all that, she squeezes in daily laundry, dishes, lunch prep and the occasional trip to the grocery store, visit to the doctor or any necessary errands. In addition to being a stay at home mom, my wife also works from home with a marketing company. Most of her work is done while the kids sleep, but there is the occasional meeting and conference call that she has to fit in her day while hopefully keeping the kids quietly entertained so her boss or clients don’t hear the commotion on the other end of the phone.

                    <h2>The End Of The Day</h2>
                    <p>
                        The day goes by in a blink of an eye. When I get home from work, she starts prepping dinner, and then it’s time for bath and the bedtime routine. We both fall into the couch exhausted once they are asleep (or in bed) but the day isn’t over yet. We each pull out our laptops and start getting to work to catch up with client emails and work requests. </p>
                    <p>
                        Our kids like keeping things interesting…8 month old is now crawling so she is constantly cleaning up after our 2yr old who leaves trails of food, or playdoh or small toys that can be eaten. If she’s not cleaning the floors, she’s rounding him up, keeping him out of the showers, away from stairs, outlets, trash or any other kind of fun things that only 8 month olds seem to be able to find around the house.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the meantime, our 2 year old likes finding an adventure wherever she goes. Her hobbies include jumping off the couch or stairs, climbing on the table and helping mommy “work” in the kitchen which can sometimes mean every container, lid, measuring cup and spoor gets taken out and spread all over the floor.

        <h3>A Little About Rachel</h3>

                <p>
                    Rachel was born and raised in Brazil and her first language is actually Portuguese. She is the daughter of missionaries that were stationed in Southern Brazil for 20 years. Rachel's work ethic no doubt comes from the emulating the women of Brazil who stay at home and take care of the family as the men of Brazil go to work. She grew up cooking from scratch and cleaning the house top to bottom daily. If I were to be honest I wouldn't know what to do without her. She effectively runs the household and keeps us crazies together.
